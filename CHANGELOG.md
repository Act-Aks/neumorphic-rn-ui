## 🎉 [1.0.0] — 2026-03-31

> The first public release of `neumorphic-rn-ui` — laying the foundation for a full neumorphic design system in React Native. Soft shadows, depth-first UI, and seamless light/dark theming out of the box.

---

### ✨ New Features

#### 🔘 `Button`

The flagship component. A fully pressable, neumorphic-styled button with raised shadow effects that respond to light and dark themes.

| Prop | Options | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `variant` | `default` · `primary` · `destructive` · `warning` | `default` |
| `size` | `default` · `icon` | `default` |
| `shape` | `default` · `circle` | `default` |

- Built with `tailwind-variants` for composable, type-safe styling
- Shadow depth adapts automatically to the active theme
- Commit: [`2586678`](https://github.com/act-aks/neumorphic-rn-ui/commit/2586678ad27bb9858f0bc6b99f2ab2c2bb03b78f)

#### 🌗 `ThemeSwitcher`

A horizontal scrollable picker to switch between light and dark modes at runtime.

- Powered by `@niibase/uniwind` for reactive theme state
- Active theme highlighted with primary color
- Minimal and composable — drop it anywhere in your layout
- Commit: [`2586678`](https://github.com/act-aks/neumorphic-rn-ui/commit/2586678ad27bb9858f0bc6b99f2ab2c2bb03b78f)
